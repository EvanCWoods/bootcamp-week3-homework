# bootcamp-week3-homework

## Overview

This repository contains the code used in the week 3 homework for the **full-stack-flex bootcamp** from The **University of Sydney.** The root directory contains the files necessary for running the code through **githjub pages** (the develop folder).

The folder titled **'develop'** contains all the code, with the script of interest being the script.js file.

The homework was to code the logic for a random password generator which created a new password based on a set of configuration questions that get prompted to the user (password length, uppercase, lowercase and special characters). This code then generates a password using the combination of user inputs.

Most of the logic in the code is based on array methods and if statements to filter for the users specifications of the password.

The code is curerntly set up to randomly select one quarter of the characters in the password, and change them to the user specified characters. The reason for one quarter is that there are four possible characters to be included, so it divides the password correctly into its component characters.
